# Simple subunit testrunner for python

# NOTE: DO NOT USE THIS MODULE FOR NEW CODE.
#
# Instead, use the standard subunit runner - e.g. "python -m subunit.run
# YOURMODULE".
#
# This wrapper will be removed once all tests can be run
# without it. At the moment there are various tests which still
# get e.g. credentials passed via command-line options to this
# script.
